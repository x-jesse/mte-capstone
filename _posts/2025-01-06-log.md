# January

## Mechanical and Electrical
Upon completion of electrical component selection (battery, drone components) last October, the drone body was assembled. To reduce costs, an Xbox Series X controller will replace a traditional transmitter. The Xbox controller ("gamepad") can be configured using the Ground Control Station (GCS) QGroundControl (QGC). The transmitter buttons will be mapped to different functions:
* The 'A' button will arm the drone
* The 'RB" button will be used for manual image capture

Battery specifications were determined last term: battery was acquired early January. A more powerful backup battery is being reserved for more intensive flight operations. An appropriate splitter is under development concurrently. The image below shows the chosen LiPo battery.

## Software
* Working to improve roof "tiling" segmentation algorithm for better coverage of roof with minimal overlap of tiles
* Researched pre-existing polygon generation/segmentation algorithms

## Embedded Software
* Early prototyping with ROS2 and image capture
* Experimented with using the Raspberry Pi OS for seamless integration with `rpicam-apps` (containing one executable for easy picture taking), abandoned this idea due to poor ROS2 support (requires Docker container)
* Wrote Dockerfile and system provisioning scripts
* Concurrently began writing provisioning documentation, and setting up both development environment as well as Ubuntu 22.04 on the Raspberry Pi

# February

## Mechanical and Electrical
Between Feb 02 and Feb 10, the remaining parts of the drone (GPS module, Flight Module Unit (FMU), propellers) were added to the main body of the drone. Electrical connections from the ESC to the motors, and from the battery to the ESCs, were made by following the [Holybro X500 V2 Assembly Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/frames_multicopter/holybro_x500v2_pixhawk6c.html). Images below capture the assembled drone without the cameras and the Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer (SBC).

QGC build guides [here](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/qgc-user-guide/setup_view/setup_view.html) were then followed to configure the vehicle. In particular:
1. The firmware running on the Pixhawk Flight Module Unit (FMU) was updated
2. The Airframe type was verified
3. The gamepad was calibrated, and the joysticks were tested for responsiveness. Button assignments were also made in preparation for end-to-end testing with the SBC.
4. The sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) were calibrated manually.
5. The ESCs were calibrated
6. The battery settings and power failsafe modes were configured
7. Basic motor throttle tests were conducted

General parameters were set to ensure the above configurations could be properly applied. Once the joysticks were calibrated, it was verfied that motor throttle changes according to user commands on the gamepad's joysticks (throttle, roll, pitch, yaw).

Tuning will be reserved until after preliminary stable flight, and after adding the payload to account for weight and CoG changes.

A power regulation board for converting battery power over USB-A/USB-C to be used by the Raspberry Pi using the IP6518 (synchronized switch buck regulator) was designed. Order was placed and received after reading week. After initial testing, it successfully powered on a spare Raspberry Pi board.

TODO: Add a picture of the splitter here

## Software
* Began research into models for roof defect detection and datasets (early to mid February)
* Began research into different types of roof designs and building processes to deepen understanding of topic and the different types of defects and their causes (late February)
* Started development of app, which will have an interface for users to upload images (offloaded from the drone) and hand them off to the model.
* Investigated datasets and started annotating data according to different classes of roof defects. Continuously trained different models and tuned hyperparameters (late February).

## Embedded Software
* Fully provisioned the Raspberry Pi with required dependencies to run the PX4 uXRCE-DDS agent, as well as the ROS2 node (early to mid February)
* Developed ROS2 node image capture node, tested image capture logic and session directory creation with dummy topics (mid February)
* Developed an application that launches a static GStreamer pipeline, achieving 1280x720 @15fps H.264 over UDP video streaming to QGroundControl
* Wrote `systemd` service files to launch the PX4 uXRCE-DDS agent, ROS2 image capture node, and the live camera

# March

## Mechanical
A mount design for the battery holder and cameras was 3D printed and fastened onto the drone to aid in prototyping prior to the demo.

TODO: Add a picture of the mount here (as part of the drone)

## Embedded Software
* Set up the PX4 toolchain + simulator (QGroundControl on Windows Host, PX4 AutoPilot simulator on Ubuntu VM) by configuring bridged network on VMWare, and manually starting up the PX4 agent. This step verified proper functionality with everything except actual PX4 HW.
* Added tuning file and experimented with different lock ring positions to improve image capture quality
* Set up Raspberry Pi as a Wi-Fi access point for direct connection, removing dependency on external networks for connectivity
* Finalized end-to-end testing, modifying PX4 agent settings to run over UART instead of over UDP. Validated image capture, session directory, and live feed logic.

## Software
* Continued research into different types of roof designs and building processes, as well as annotation of data and training of model
* Continued development of user interface
