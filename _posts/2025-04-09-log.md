# Summary Log

### Project Overview & Goal

The RoofRecon project aimed to develop a drone-based system to enhance the safety, efficiency, and data quality of residential roof inspections, addressing the risks and limitations associated with traditional manual methods. The final system utilizes a semi-autonomous drone combined with photogrammetry and computer vision to generate 3D rooftop models and identify surface defects.

### System Architecture

The system is composed of several key subsystems:

1.  **Drone Platform:** A quadrotor drone under 10kg, equipped with a high-resolution downward-facing camera for inspection imagery and a front-facing navigation camera. It uses a Pixhawk Flight Controller with PX4 autopilot software.
2.  **Embedded System:** A Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer (SBC) running Ubuntu Server manages camera operations and interfaces with the flight controller via the uXRCE-DDS bridge (connecting PX4 uORB messages to ROS2). Key software components include:
    * A ROS2 node for capturing high-resolution images triggered by the remote controller. Images are organized into timestamped session directories.
    * A GStreamer pipeline processes the navigation camera feed, encoding it in H264 and streaming it via UDP to the Ground Control Station.
    * Systemd services ensure all necessary software modules start on boot.
3.  **Ground Control & Communications:** QGroundControl software serves as the Ground Control Station (GCS) for manual piloting, receiving telemetry and the live navigation video stream over a 915 MHz radio link.
4.  **Power System:** A custom PCB featuring an IP6518 buck converter steps down LiPo battery voltage (connected via XT60) to a regulated 5V, supplied through USB-A and USB-C ports for onboard components.
5.  **Offline Processing Pipeline:**
    * **Defect Detection:** Captured images are processed offline using a YOLOv12 deep learning model trained on an augmented dataset (~700 images) via Roboflow to identify defects like punctures, cracks, hail impacts, and degranulation. The model achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 38.4%.
    * **3D Reconstruction:** Overlapping images are processed using the COLMAP API to generate sparse 3D point cloud reconstructions of the roof via Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques.
6.  **Data Display Application:** A user-friendly Qt-based desktop application allows users to:
    * Load image sets captured during flights.
    * Run the defect detection model on the images.
    * View individual images with highlighted defect bounding boxes, confidence scores, and detailed damage information.
    * Browse, manage, and delete previously stored image sets.
    * (Implicitly) View the 3D sparse reconstruction for spatial context.

### Key Outcomes & Status

* The system successfully met primary constraints and criteria, including weight (<10kg), operational range (>100m), battery life (>10 min), inspection accuracy (>30% mAP), and data visualization requirements.
* The final cost was approximately \$1578.72 CAD.
* Significant design deviations included adopting the uXRCE-DDS bridge over mavros and switching to the Raspberry Pi HQ camera due to compatibility issues. The data display approach was modified from a single stitched 2D map to showing individual images alongside a 3D reconstruction to avoid potential misinterpretations caused by image stitching artifacts.
* Testing confirmed component functionality (power circuit, embedded software modules, GCS connection range) and system performance (defect detection accuracy, battery life). User testing validated the intuitiveness of the data display application.

### Future Recommendations

* Enhance defect detection model accuracy by training on a larger, more diverse dataset.
* Implement dense 3D reconstruction using GPU processing for more detailed visualization.
* Improve usability by adding USB gadget mode for easier data transfer and implementing autonomous flight capabilities via PX4 offboard mode.
* Add visual indicators for system readiness.
