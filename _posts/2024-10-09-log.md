## Problem Definition

Roof inspections are currently conducted manually, which involves significant safety risks, high labor costs, and extended inspection times. This process is especially challenging on steep or damaged roofs. The project aims to develop an autonomous robotic system capable of performing roof inspections, collecting accurate data, and identifying structural issues in real-time. The system must be able to navigate various roof types, ensure safe operation, and provide efficient, high-quality inspections while reducing the need for human involvement.

## Needs Statement

There is a need to safely and efficiently perform roof inspections, providing detailed data for identifying structural issues, while minimizing risks of injury from manual inspection, improving overall inspection efficiency.

[US10013720B1 - Utilizing a 3D scanner to estimate damage to a roof - Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10013720B1/en?q=(analysis+of+roof+damage)&oq=analysis+of+roof+damage)

**Summary:**

- Proposed use of a 3D scanner (device that uses a variety of techniques – laser triangulation, time of flight, structured light, photogrammetry (using images)) to reconstruct the 3D geometry of a roof
- Does this using a point cloud is a discrete set of data points in space → 3D
- Analyzes the point cloud to detect individual shingles of a roof + potential damage on each of these shingles

**Summary:**

- Aerial imagery is one of the most popular sources for existing data sets, but suffers from lack of height information
- Combine it with LiDar for distance detection
- Existing roof modelling: mesh modelling and roof style modelling -very detailed, not feasible to render have their own drawbacks
- Instead of purely training a model just on images, determining the roof style can be done using normalized roof data points selected from the point cloud combined with synthetic roof model data (simulation, statistical models)

**Summary:**

- Proposed an image analysis system that receives original roof images, extracts features on a processed image, analyzes these features using image analysis rules to determine hail damage (if it occurred and where)

## Constraints

- **Weight and Size Limitations**: The robotic system must be lightweight and compact enough to navigate rooftops without damaging surfaces or posing additional risks.
- **Battery Life**: The robot should have a minimum operational time of 30 minutes on a single charge to complete inspections of small to medium-sized roofs.
- **Environmental Durability**: The system must be weather-resistant, capable of operating in various environmental conditions, such as wind, rain, and varying temperatures.
- **Safety Regulations**: The design must comply with local and national safety regulations for drones/robots, particularly Transport Canada’s UAV regulations.
- **Autonomy**: The system must function autonomously or semi-autonomously, minimizing human intervention during the inspection process.
- **Data Transmission**: The robot must be able to transmit data wirelessly in real-time to an operator or a central system for analysis.
- **Cost**: The total project budget, including development and materials, must not exceed a specified cap (e.g., $5,000) to ensure feasibility.

## Criteria
- **Navigation Capability**: The robot should be able to traverse complex roof structures, including varying slopes and obstacles, with stability.
- **Inspection Accuracy**: The system must be capable of detecting key roof issues such as cracks, leaks, and surface damage with at least 70% accuracy.
- **Ease of Use**: The user interface for controlling or monitoring the robot should be intuitive and accessible to operators with minimal technical expertise.
- **Operational Range**: The robot should be able to cover at least 100 square meters in one deployment.
- **Portability**: The robot must be easy to transport, assemble, and deploy, ideally fitting in a standard-sized case.
- **Maintenance**: The system should have low maintenance requirements, with easy-to-replace parts and a long operational lifespan.
