## Patents

[US10013720B1 - Utilizing a 3D scanner to estimate damage to a roof - Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10013720B1/en?q=(analysis+of+roof+damage)&oq=analysis+of+roof+damage)

Summary:

- Proposed use of a 3D scanner (device that uses a variety of techniques – laser triangulation, time of flight, structured light, photogrammetry (using images)) to reconstruct the 3D geometry of a roof
- Does this using a point cloud is a discrete set of data points in space → 3D
- Analyzes the point cloud to detect individual shingles of a roof + potential damage on each of these shingles

[US10013507B2 - Learning synthetic models for roof style classification using point clouds - Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10013507B2/en?q=(analysis+of+building+roofs)&oq=analysis+of+building+roofs)

Summary:

- Aerial imagery is one of the most popular sources for existing data sets, but suffers from lack of height information
- Combine it with LiDar for distance detection
- Existing roof modelling: mesh modelling and roof style modelling -very detailed, not feasible to render have their own drawbacks
- Instead of purely training a model just on images, determining the roof style can be done using normalized roof data points selected from the point cloud combined with synthetic roof model data (simulation, statistical models)

[US10796149B2 - System and method for performing video or still image analysis on building structures - Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10796149B2/en?q=(analysis+of+building+roofs)&oq=analysis+of+building+roofs)

Summary:

- Proposed an image analysis system that receives original roof images, extracts features on a processed image, analyzes these features using image analysis rules to determine hail damage (if it occurred and where)
