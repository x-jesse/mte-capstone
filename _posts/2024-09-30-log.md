- discussed with Professor Chul Min Yeum regarding the scope of the project
- emphasized the importance of data presentation, using 3D models for visualization, and 
automating the damage detection process
- revised project scope by narrowing it from large structure inspection to roof analysis
- as mentioned by Prof. Yeum, roof assessment is much more feasible given the scope of the
project 
- we'd like to train ML models for roof damage detection by offloading drone footage
