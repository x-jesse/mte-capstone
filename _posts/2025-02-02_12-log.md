# Embedded

## Gamepad and Battery
To reduce costs, an Xbox Series X controller will replace a traditional transmitter. The Xbox controller ("gamepad") can be configured using the Ground Control Station (GCS) QGroundControl (QGC).

Battery specifications were determined with electrical team member; battery was acquired on February 04. A more powerful backup battery is being reserved for more intensive flight operations. An appropriate splitter is under development concurrently.

## Drone Assembly
Between Feb 02 and Feb 10, the drone was assembled by following the [Holybro X500 V2 Assembly Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/frames_multicopter/holybro_x500v2_pixhawk6c.html). Images below capture the assembled drone without the cameras and the Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer (SBC).

QGC build guides [here](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/qgc-user-guide/setup_view/setup_view.html) were then followed to configure the vehicle. In particular:
1. The firmware running on the Pixhawk Flight Module Unit (FMU) was updated
2. The Airframe type was verified
3. The gamepad was calibrated, and the joysticks were tested for responsiveness. Button assignments were also made in preparation for end-to-end testing with the SBC.
4. The sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) were calibrated manually.
5. The ESCs were calibrated
6. The battery settings and power failsafe modes were configured
7. Basic motor throttle tests were conducted

General parameters were set to ensure the above configurations could be properly applied. Once the joysticks were calibrated, it was verfied that motor throttle changes according to user commands on the gamepad's joysticks (throttle, roll, pitch, yaw).

Tuning will be reserved until after preliminary stable flight, and after adding the payload to account for weight and CoG changes.
