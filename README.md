# Semi-Autonomous Drone for Structural Analysis - Design Log

We're interested in building a solution for structural integrity analysis and automating manual building inspection. An automated solution will be more cost-effective and safer, since inspectors will no longer need to traverse the exterior of structures.

**UPDATE: After discussion with Dr. Chul Min Yeum, we've narrowed our scope down to an automated roof inspection system.** The updated design scope will no longer require analysis of every part of the structure, and we will focus on identifying damage specific to shingle roofs like those found on suburban houses. 

Our primary solutions are:

1. Building a semi-autonomous drone and flying it around the structure, taking pictures and performing damage inference using CV/ML

2. Embedding sensors directly into the building structure, monitoring the structure health via various indicators like humidity.

- discussed with Professor Chul Min Yeum regarding the scope of the project
- emphasized the importance of data presentation, using 3D models for visualization, and 
automating the damage detection process
- revised project scope by narrowing it from large structure inspection to roof analysis
- as mentioned by Prof. Yeum, roof assessment is much more feasible given the scope of the
project 
- we'd like to train ML models for roof damage detection by offloading drone footage
