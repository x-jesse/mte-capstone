We're interested in building a solution for structural integrity analysis and automating manual building inspection. An automated solution will be more cost-effective and safer, since inspectors will no longer need to traverse the exterior of structures.

**UPDATE: After discussion with Dr. Chul Min Yeum, we've narrowed our scope down to an automated roof inspection system.** The updated design scope will no longer require analysis of every part of the structure, and we will focus on identifying damage specific to shingle roofs like those found on suburban houses. 

Our primary solutions are:

1. Building a semi-autonomous drone and flying it around the structure, taking pictures and performing damage inference using CV/ML

2. Embedding sensors directly into the building structure, monitoring the structure health via various indicators like humidity. 

3.
